The TDP must be based on the official league TDP template and must contain the following information:
 
    Description of the hardware and software including a list of integrated
    externally available components (including commercial products, freeware, Open Source, etc.)
    Innovative technology and scientific contribution
    Photo(s) of the robot
    Focus of research/research interests
    Re-usability of the system for other research groups
    Applicability of the robot in the real world

 The TDP goes into detail about the technical and scientific approach, but the website should be designed for a broader audience.

The length of the TDP is limited to 8 pages. Please use the same Springer LNAI format used in the RoboCup Symposium submissions.
